										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The infamous founder of <em>Silk Road</em>, the original darknet market, <a href="https://freeross.org/genesis-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> a collection of NFTs yesterday, based on writings and artwork created while serving a double-life sentence in a US federal prison.</p>



<p>Now 37, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced for crimes related to his activities at <em>Silk Road</em> in 2015, when he was 29 years old. His original series, known as <em>The Genesis Collection</em>, consists of 10 NFTs in all and is currently up for auction at the <a href="https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/ross-ulbricht-genesis-collection-30841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SuperRare</a> NFT marketplace.</p>



<p>A message on <a href="https://freeross.org/genesis-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeRoss.org</a> conveys the following insight into Ulbricht’s motivation behind the release:</p>



<p>“<em>Decades of incarceration stretch out in front of me. As I face that future &#8211; my eventual old age and death in this cage &#8211; I find myself looking for meaning and purpose. Why am I here? What good can I do with the time I have left and from where I am? I hope that helping my fellow prisoners through my art is one way.” &#8211; Ross Ulbricht</em></p>



<p>Proceeds from the auction will be used to “fund efforts to relieve the suffering of the incarcerated and their families, as well as the fight to free Ross from a life in prison,” according to its description on SuperRare.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The current high bid for the collection is a whopping 261 ETH, which currently equates to about $1.17 million. In addition to writings and artworks crafted by Ulbricht, the NFT collection also includes “a 2m40s original animation by Levitate, created in collaboration with Ross.” The auction is open for bids until Dec 7.</p>

<p>Ulbricht described the process for development of his NFT in a heart-wrenching <a href="https://rossulbricht.medium.com/my-nft-f2b4a9f1955c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Medium</em></a> post. “I told a story with words and drawings of a typical day in maximum security, and my collaborators animated it from my point of view as a prisoner,” he said. “That is all bundled into the NFT. It is my story as art.”</p>
