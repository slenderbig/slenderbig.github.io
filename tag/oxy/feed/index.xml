<p>A North Carolina man was <a href="https://www.cbs17.com/news/north-carolina-news/nc-man-gets-20-years-for-using-dark-web-to-sell-counterfeit-pills-laced-with-fentanyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sentenced</a> to 240 months behind bars on Wednesday for selling fake Oxycontin and Xanax pills over the darknet. Dylan Hunter Holcomb, 28, is the latest darknet vendor to receive a stiff sentence for their role in contributing to America’s ongoing opioid crisis by selling home-pressed pills laced with fentanyl and labeled as a different drug.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2022/01/28/dark-web-fentanyl-distributor-receives-20-year-sentence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the US Postal Inspector intercepted several suspicious packages in January 2020 originating from Holcomb’s hometown area. The DEA then managed to identify Holcomb’s Washington, North Carolina address as the source two months later, arresting him at home, where they quickly discovered his pill-making enterprise.</p>

<p>While most of the confiscated pills were to be sold as fake Oxycontin, 418 were meant to be fake Xanax pills, though the principally-acting chemical in both formulations was fentanyl. The other ingredients in the pills were only described as “mixing compounds” in a sheriff’s report. Packages to be sent to customers were similarly-wrapped and pills destined to become fake Oxys were colored blue to mimic the real product.</p>

<p>Holcomb plead guilty to the charges against him in June of last year. During sentencing, Chief Judge Richard E. Myers II made particular mention of the fact that fentanyl is a growing problem across much of America, leading to an <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/drug-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">increasing number of deaths</a> each year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A North Carolina man will spend 26 months behind bars after pleading guilty to charges of Distribution of Oxycodone. Accused of importing the drug for resale to local markets, Wesley McKeehan, 34, admitted in federal court earlier this week to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/north-carolina-man-sentenced-federal-prison-distributing-opioids-through-dark-web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtaining it from a Chinese supplier on the dark web</a>.</p>



<p>McKeehan was initially indicted on the charges in April; the result of an investigation started by a tip-off from a postal center.</p>



<p>On Aug. 13, 2020, the DEA office in Savannah, Georgia was contacted by a local post office that had received a package suspected of containing controlled substances. DEA agents then followed delivery of the package to an address belonging to a 50-year-old Savannah man. Upon delivery, the agents searched the package and found that it contained oxycodone pills. They then confronted the package owner who admitted to allowing McKeehan to use his business address for drug order imports.</p>



<p>North Carolina is among the states hit hardest by America’s opioid crisis, with painkillers like oxycodone accounting for about <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state/north-carolina-opioid-involved-deaths-related-harms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80% of drug-related deaths</a> in the state. Pills like the ones to be sold by McKeehan are a generic version of OxyContin, the Purdue Pharma drug largely regarded as responsible for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1031053251/sackler-family-immunity-purdue-pharma-oxcyontin-opioid-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">igniting a health crisis across the United States</a>.</p>



<p>In February, corporate consultants who worked for Purdue agreed to pay North Carolina $20 million to <a href="https://ncdoj.gov/news-observer-opioid-settlement-will-bring-nearly-20-million-to-nc-how-should-it-be-spent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid a potential state-wide lawsuit</a> for their work in pushing the highly-addictive substance.</p>



<p>As part of the sentencing, McKeehan will serve an additional three years of supervised release after his prison sentence ends in 2023. McKeehan’s accomplice was charged with acquiring and possession of controlled substances by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, and deception or subterfuge. He will serve no prison time but rather probation. Documents provided by McKeehan’s lawyers <a href="https://salisburypost.com/2021/09/28/salisbury-man-pleads-guilty-to-importing-opioids-into-georgia-through-the-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indicate</a> their client will not appeal the case.</p>
