<p>A 45-year-old drug at the center of a new controversy is showing some popularity on darknet markets.</p>



<p>Ivermectin, a medication used to treat parasitic infections in both humans and animals, is now being marketed as a covid-19 combatant on the dark web. The drug was recently touted by comedian and podcaster icon Joe Rogan as an ingredient to overcoming his quick bout with the illness, which caused the FDA to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/joe-rogan-covid-19-ivermectin-federal-warnings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue a stern reminder</a> that it had not yet been approved as a treatment.</p>



<p>Most darknet market listings for ivermectin come with the same boilerplate language, including something of a vague and potentially controversial claim:</p>



<p>“By taking Ivermectin, it means the body can fight the infection like normal, because its antiviral response hasn’t been reduced by the viral proteins.”</p>



<p>While some markets have policies that strictly forbid the sales of anything specifically related to covid, ivermectin has medicinal use in the treatment of bacterial infections and is thus not usually excluded from listing. Other markets, such as Dark0de, have chosen to embrace covid as an opportunity, even designating a specific category for it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My son was prescribed ivermectin (for humans) when he had COVID in January. We switched to a different treatment in the ER. Still have a bunch. Wonder if I can pay off a student loan selling it on the dark web… <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/joking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#joking</a></p>&mdash; Moira B (@moidem) <a href="https://twitter.com/moidem/status/1432473393564196867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Dark0de, ToRReZ and Empire Market had about a dozen listings for different brand variations of the drug, with the most popular known as Stromectol. Versus market had a single listing for Stromectol with no sales, and several others had none. At $0.40 to $0.60 per milligram on average, prices for most listings were highly competitive with pharmacy generics, with some Americans reportedly paying far more for the drug under their health insurance plan.</p>



<p>Most vendors of ivermectin claim to ship out of India or Singapore. One vendor, going by the name <em>thebodyshop</em>, has managed to rack up several ivermectin sales across multiple markets, with some customers even confirming their satisfaction with the order.</p>

<p>Prior to the rise of ransomware-related attacks earlier this year, the mainstream media’s darknet market focus was on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-11/dark-web-has-become-a-marketplace-for-vaccines-and-other-pandemic-scams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rise of covid-related items for sale</a> which totaled an estimated $100 million across 25 markets before the end of 2020. In March 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/who-warns-against-sales-of-counterfeit-covid-vaccines-on-the-dark-web.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rise of fake COVID-19 vaccinations</a> for sale on the dark web.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="575" height="330" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-804" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2.png 575w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></figure>



<p>In the United States, poison control centers across the country are currently witnessing <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/09/04/1034217306/ivermectin-overdose-exposure-cases-poison-control-centers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surges in reports of ivermectin overdoses</a>. Although ivermectin has demonstrated some efficacy in the prevention and treatment of covid-19, doctors caution that its unmonitored usage could result in overdose or exacerbated side effects. Some of the drug’s side effects include eye pain, skin rash, confusion, fast heart rate, and loss of bladder control.</p>



<p>The FDA first <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cautioned against the use of ivermectin</a> to treat covid-19 in March, noting that large doses of the drug are &#8220;dangerous and can cause serious harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The demand for <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/safety-quality/yes-some-people-really-are-faking-their-covid-vaccine-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falsified covid vaccine documentation</a> is on the rise, with darknet markets and secret Telegram groups now regularly selling fake vaccination cards. The trend is especially prevalent in Russia, where provision of medical services may be available only to those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/14733-fake-covid-19-vaccination-cards-emerge-in-russia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), fake vaccination card production is so lucrative in Russia that doctors and nurses regularly assist fraudsters in manufacturing the credentials. This includes altering the vaccination registry to include phony entries and even <a href="https://baza.io/posts/ac4e2515-10f5-4c60-b6cd-fbee4e318feb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroying doses of unlabeled vaccine</a> to create evidence for the registry.</p>



<p>In many other countries, vaccination cards are requisites for employment, school, or university attendance, and even travel. In the US, the FBI first warned the public to be on the lookout for fake vaccination cards in late March.</p>

<p>Mike Linder, emerging threats expert at Check Point Software Technologies <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/safety-quality/yes-some-people-really-are-faking-their-covid-vaccine-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> <em>Modern Healthcare </em>last week that “in the beginning, bad actors were selling fake vaccine cards on the dark web… Now much of it has migrated to peer-to-peer direct messaging platforms.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge business opportunity… There&#8217;s no magic to creating them. You just use Photoshop, you take a pen, you write stuff. There&#8217;s a market to buy them.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Example of a forged covid vaccination card that is personalized using details provided by the buyer.</em></p>



<p>Fake vaccination “passports” have been sold on darknet markets for about as long as there has been a vaccine. A reluctance to get vaccinated, for any number of reasons, has encouraged a certain segment of the global population to seek out fake documents to resume ordinary activities of their daily lives. While entirely illegal, a price tag as cheap as $10 (in some areas) may seem too good a deal for some to pass up.</p>



<p>In March, doses of vaccine itself &#8211; made by AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm and Johnson &amp; Johnson &#8211; were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56489574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found to be on sale</a> for anywhere between $500 and $750. Health experts and government officials remind the public that, in most cases, <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/06/29/yes-some-people-really-are-faking-their-covid-vaccine-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covid vaccination is free</a>, as are official vaccination cards.</p>
