										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s been one week since one of the world’s top darknet markets, White House Market, <a href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/77f2b8521f9ae0fda3a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> they were pulling the plug on operations, and its admins are being praised for the orderliness of the closure across social media.</p>



<p>Darknet market communities on Reddit, Twitter and Dread have thus far expressed overwhelmingly positive sentiment about the way the closure is being handled, which includes processing withdrawals from remaining user balances as promised and allowing vendors to let customers know on what other markets they can be found.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Proof you can run a good, respectable, risk-reducing market and exit without scamming people, or getting busted. Be Like WHM.</p>&mdash; uɐpʇou@ ✸ (@notdan) <a href="https://twitter.com/notdan/status/1444291649165684736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>“Compromises are not a matter of if but when,” commented Dread admin Paris, in a forum thread dedicated to the market’s closure.</p>



<p>“<em>All markets should have a path to exit the scene. Get in, do what you want to do, and then leave with bags of money. Gracefully exiting allows another market to shine.” – Paris, Dread Forum</em></p>



<p>Also up for discussion was which market would be most likely to assume White House’s position as the world’s number one darknet market (outside of Russia, which is still dominated by Hydra). Most opinion seemed to lean toward Dark0de as the replacement as it is the next biggest by sales volume, slightly trailed by ToRReZ, and AlphaBay still a dark horse with continued lackluster activity.</p>



<p>“The people running WHM are the best of the best,” said one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/q1omp4/comment/hfhot00/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">redditor</a>, going on to explain how the market had always come through for him in times of disputes and other issues.</p>



<p>“<em>I wished them good will and personally if I lost me last order to (a) scammer I wouldn&#8217;t care. But I didn’t, they are still working , and coming through. Fkn legends. The best of the best.” – Deancrypt, Reddit</em></p>



<p>Making the decision to go out on top has so far proven to be a good one for the White House admins, who are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/q1omp4/how_much_money_did_whm_make/">estima</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/q1omp4/how_much_money_did_whm_make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/q1omp4/how_much_money_did_whm_make/">ed</a> to have walked away with somewhere between $25 and $50 million in crypto proceeds, based on buyer and seller statistics displayed on the market. This includes vendor bond deposits, the 5% collected by the market from each sale, funds in abandoned wallets, and funds confiscated from banned users.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m sad to see it go but as far as exits go, this is about as clean as it gets folks,” said another Dread user in the market’s retirement PSA. “Kudos to WHM, I&#8217;m glad you all made it out before a negative event caused the demise.”</p>



<p>As of the writing of this article, the URL for White House was still up and available for access by customers to withdraw their remaining balances.</p>
