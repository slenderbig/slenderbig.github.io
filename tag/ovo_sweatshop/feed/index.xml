<p>A former Goldman Sachs employee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/nyregion/thomas-spieker-bitcoin-scheme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indicted</a> on laundering over $2.3 million in Bitcoin for various scamming operations also funded a well-known darknet market vendor specializing in ketamine, according to charges recently filed by New York federal prosecutors.</p>



<p>In addition to converting BTC into cash for carding scammers, Nigerian “catfishers” and an “eastern European crime syndicate,” Thomas Spieker, 42, allegedly <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10650791/New-York-man-42-indicted-running-2-3M-cash-Bitcoin-money-laundering-scheme-crooks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided $38,000 in laundered funds</a> to two people behind the <em>OVO_sweatshop</em> darknet market vendor moniker, Zashan Khan and Cosma Siekierski. The vendor maintained a <a href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/u/ovosweatshop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presence</a> on the <em>Dread</em> forum, racking up hundreds of positive reviews across multiple darknet markets during their 1-2 years in operation.</p>



<p>Investigators allege the <em>OVO_sweatshop</em> vendor name was later taken over by John Humphrey and Fidello Palermo, both 51, who operated it out of a facility in Rochester, New York. The duo were arrested during a trip to Brooklyn where authorities found they were carrying 1.7 kg of ketamine powder/crystals and 140 vials of liquid ketamine.</p>

<p>A total of seven people are being held in association with Spieker’s actions and face a large assortment of charges, ranging from conspiracy to commit money laundering to illegal drug charges.</p>



<p>According to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-spieker-60749062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn profile</a>, Spieker was an Equity Derivates Specialist at Goldman Sachs from Feb 2001 to Mar 2003, founding a hip hop and club music promotion business named S!CK Productions in Nov 2010. His interest in music production and the club scene goes back to the year 2000.</p>



<p>The vendor name stems from a clothing line started by musician Drake, with ‘OVO’ standing for “October’s Very Own.”</p>

<p>Although Empire Market exit scammed in late August 2020, <em>OVO_sweatshop</em> was quick to set up replacement stores on White House Market and Dark Market within a matter of weeks. The quality of their operation apparently degraded over the following year, with customers complaining on <em>Dread</em> of receiving watered-down product and being victims of selective scamming by the vendor.</p>



<p><em>OVO_sweatshop</em> also provided pills listed as Xanax and MDMA that received widely varying reviews, although this product took a back seat to their more consistent ketamine-vending operations.</p>



<p>All seven parties arrested and facing trial have pled not guilty to the charges against them.</p>
