										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The era of the world’s most infamous collective of malware masterminds came to a close on Thursday as three cybersecurity experts working for the U.S. government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the notorious REvil hacking group had been taken offline, for what may be the last time.</p>



<p>According to top-level REvil organizer <em>0 neday</em>, the notorious malware operation was hacked by an unnamed infiltrator. &#8220;The server was compromised, and they were looking for me,&#8221; wrote <em>0 neday</em> on a well-known cybercrime forum. “Good luck, everyone; I&#8217;m off,” he concluded his last post, <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1451624106005311505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned</a> from the forum by a moderator mere hours later.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The US seizing the Tor sites of the REvil gang over the weekend has had some interesting effects on ransomware groups today<br><br>Just earlier, the Conti gang published a long-winded announcement on the matter<br><br>Among the highlights, they call their activity as &quot;the art of pen-testing&quot; <a href="https://t.co/2rV3rWgmOp">pic.twitter.com/2rV3rWgmOp</a></p>&mdash; Catalin Cimpanu (@campuscodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1451600246778253315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Brought to global attention after its role in the shutdown of major beef processing plants in four countries and disrupting supply globally in the process, REvil first disappeared on July 13<sup>th</sup>, only to resurface under a different structure weeks later.</p>



<p>There is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/multiple-governments-involved-in-coordinated-takedown-of-revil-ransomware-group-reuters/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&amp;taid=6172f52435a2610001af21b0&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">little doubt</a> that REvil’s infrastructure takedown is the result of U.S.-orchestrated efforts.</p>



<p>On July 23<sup>rd</sup>, Kaseya, a Swedish grocery store chain whose systems had been encrypted by REvil-associated malware, announced it had received a decryption key for the files encrypted earlier that month, which was later discovered to have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57946117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given to them by the FBI</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The notorious Conti ransomware-as-a-service gang has apparently issued a statement on the U.S. takedown of their competitors in REvil.<br><br>(via <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vxunderground</a>) <a href="https://t.co/fnwZQCjWGg">pic.twitter.com/fnwZQCjWGg</a></p>&mdash; kpoulsen (@kpoulsen) <a href="https://twitter.com/kpoulsen/status/1451637440591155201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Plans for retaliation were discovered today as other ransomware groups <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/groove-ransomware-calls-on-all-extortion-gangs-to-attack-us-interests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called for cyber warfare against U.S. interests</a>. Portions of a publicly-posted message composed by a self-identified Groove Ransomware member translated to the following warning:</p>



<p>“<em>In our difficult and troubled time when the US government is trying to fight us, I call on all partner programs to stop competing, unite and start fucking up the US public sector, show this old man who is the boss here who is the boss and will be on the Internet…</em></p>



<p>… <em>I urge not to attack Chinese companies, because where do we pinch if our homeland suddenly turns away from us, only to our good neighbors &#8211; the Chinese! I BELIEVE THAT ALL ZONES IN THE USA WILL BE OPENED, ALL HOES WILL COME OUT AND FUCK THIS FUCKING BIDEN IN ALL THE CRACKS, I myself will personally make efforts to do this&#8221; &#8211; Groove ransomware, 10/22/21</em></p>



<p>Other security researchers have <a href="https://threatpost.com/revil-servers-offline-governments/175675/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no</a><a href="https://threatpost.com/revil-servers-offline-governments/175675/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">t</a><a href="https://threatpost.com/revil-servers-offline-governments/175675/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ed</a> that the chance for the re-emergence of REvil’s core members under a different guise remains something to consider.</p>



<p>Among REvil’s targets over the last two years are Donald Trump, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Acer, and Lenovo.</p>
