<p><em>Was it Putin, the U.S., or rivals that took down what is likely to be the most well-known ransomware group of all-time? Or was the time for REvil to exit the stage just right?</em></p>



<p>The notorious REvil ransomware network, allegedly responsible for over 360 ransomware attacks during the last two years, had its <a href="https://www.govinfosecurity.com/revils-infrastructure-goes-offline-a-17061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online presence removed completely</a> yesterday, through actions and actors that are completely unknown.</p>



<p>The components taken down from the dark web include REvil’s portals for data leaks, extortion attempts and resulting payments. It also includes the public-facing centerpiece for REvil, the <em>Happy Blog</em> website. <em>Happy Blog</em> is where REvil posted the latest details of their successful efforts, frequently bragging about their most recent exploits and issuing threats to potential future victims.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1013" height="305" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-689" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.png 1013w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-300x90.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-768x231.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /><figcaption>Happy Blog screenshot courtesy of GovInfoSecurity.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In one of the last posts on <em>Happy Blog</em>, REvil claimed to have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-10/kaseya-failed-to-address-security-before-hack-ex-employees-say" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infected over a million systems</a> belonging to international IT vendor Kaseya Ltd. In the post, REvil asks for a whopping $70 million ransom &#8211; payable in Bitcoin &#8211; in exchange for a “publicly decryptor (sp.) that decrypts files of all victims.”</p>



<p>After a meeting with Russian President Putin on July 9, U.S. President Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/martinmatishak/status/1413572561527574528/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that a line of communication had been opened between the two countries that would be dedicated to cyberattack-related affairs.</p>



<p>“I made it very clear to him that the United States expects when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it&#8217;s not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is,&#8221; said Biden.</p>



<p>It is not known if Biden’s meeting with Putin contributed to the sudden disappearance of REvil’s presence on the darknet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="443" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1024x443.png" alt="" class="wp-image-690" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-1024x443.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-300x130.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-768x332.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.png 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The result of visiting the former URL of Happy Blog, REvil’s primary darknet portal.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Security researchers note that malware/ransom operations like REvil often disband and re-appear under a new name to escape an increasingly negative reputation.</p>



<p>As almost no information about what caused the knockout is available, it is possible that the individuals behind the REvil banner have not been taken into custody and will simply re-emerge when the moment is right.</p>



<p>Next time, however, the light exposed on their movements will likely be all the brighter, as the internationally-coordinated crackdown on ransomware groups continues.</p>
