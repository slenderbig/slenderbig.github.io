										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A joint private/public sector effort between Group-IB, a world leader in cybersecurity, and Europol’s European Cybercrime Center (EC3) is putting a dent in darknet market-related credit card fraud, to the tune of <a href="https://itconnect.lat/portal/2021/11/29/europol-000000000000000000002021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">about €53 million over the last two years</a>. Most recently, Group-IB provided the EC3 with enough information to prevent about €14 million in losses.</p>



<p>The law enforcement end of the collaboration, known as <em>Carding Action 2021</em>, involves agencies from the UK and Europol working together to target marketplaces and specialty “card shops” scattered across the dark web. Group-IB, the only private sector firm involved in the operation, makes use of proprietary means to detect botnets and JS-sniffers capable of hijacking credit card details, with victims identified all around the globe.</p>

Source: Group-IB </em><a href="https://blog.group-ib.com/awc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>blog post</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Clandestine carding stores on the darknet monitored by Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence and Attribution System <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/12-online-fraudsters-arrested-in-global-operation-against-counterfeiters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> 12 individual vendors were responsible for 49,761 instances of credit card theft over a three-month monitoring period. Group-IB found that card details were most often compromised via phishing websites. Details were also stolen when user devices became infected with “banking trojans,” or via “highjacked” e-commerce websites.</p>



<p>Last year, <em>Carding Action 2020</em>, a three-month, cross-border operation, prevented approx. €40 million in losses by similarly identifying fraudulently-obtained credit card info. According to <em>Group-IB</em>’s <em>Hi-Tech Crime Trends Report 20/21</em>, presented yesterday at <a href="https://2021.group-ib.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>CyberCrimeCon</em></a>, the overall carding market grew some 116% over the last year, from $880 million to $1.9 billion. The increase in losses was suggested to be due to the expansion of JS-sniffer attacks targeting e-commerce merchants across the EU region.</p>



<p>Group-IB is expected to release more of their findings about the current state of the darknet carding market during <em>CyberCrimeCon</em> later this week.</p>
