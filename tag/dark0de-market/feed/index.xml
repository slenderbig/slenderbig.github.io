]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This year’s spate of darknet market closures has left much of the community feeling hopeless and turning to social media to vent their frustrations over the dissolving trust they once had for such operations. Most recently, Dark0de – once considered to be one of the best darknet markets – pulled a <a href="/dark0de-exit-scam-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rather sudden exit scam</a>, taking all user funds held in their system along with them.</p>



<p>In addition to Dark0de, there have been at least three other major darknet market closures this year, leading some to ponder if there was perhaps a better way to go about implementing and running them; ideally removing the risk of closure. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/t4xm68/tired_of_exit_scams_why_a_fully_decentralized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> in the r/darknet subreddit by u/lorenzlams addressing these questions managed to draw over 100 net upvotes and 116 comments within its first 20 hours, spurring a heated (though heavily moderated) conversation.</p>



<p>“It should be totally possible to build a fully decentralized and open market protocol, working on any of the existing L1 blockchain networks, smart contract based, etc,” wrote u/lorenzlams. “I&#8217;m surprised this doesn&#8217;t exist yet,” they added.</p>



<p>Several thread respondents in the Reddit thread pointed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBazaar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenBazaar</a> as a prototype for decentralized market management; the project itself initially created as a “proof-of-concept” to tackle the idea of a distributed darknet market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="727" height="284" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1344" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.png 727w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></figure>



<p>Other respondents pointed out the need for some sort of a moderation team to prevent scams &#8212; an integral component of any darknet market that is somewhat dependent on centralization. Another problem to be faced by decentralized markets is the issue of fund management, which is not just potentially risky but a turnoff to average users, as well.</p>



<p>“I don’t know much about crypto tech but anyone involved in fueling a blockchain solely based on the illegal drug industry would be arrested I’m sure,” wrote u/hardwire_to_eat in response to the above-mentioned thread. “Escrow makes people feel much safer.”</p>



<p>A dive into claims made by market admins during the early stages of their market reveals that <a href="https://darknetlive.com/post/markets-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly all of them lie about their intentions</a>. Provided as evidence in the linked article were empty promises made the admins of Samsara Market, Nightmare Market, Dark0de, Kingdom Market, and Icarus &#8212; all of which ended up exit scamming between one month and two years after opening.</p>



<p>Despite the string of exit scams this year, some markets (such as White House Market and Cannazon) do manage to perform “graceful exits,” giving their users a warning of impending closure and providing them with ample time to withdraw their funds before shutting their servers down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After a week of delayed withdrawals and other issues suggesting an exit scam was likely, Dark0de – one of the biggest and most popular darknet markets to ever exist – <a href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/3b03396226d17850311b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">went offline</a> on Feb 24<sup>th</sup> without warning, taking user funds trapped in escrow along with it. There was no announcement made by the market admins as to what had happened or why the site was no longer available, but activity preceding the closure suggests it was a willful and coordinated effort to scam buyers and vendors.</p>



<p>“At this stage the facts are that onions are down and the dark0de admin /u/dark0dereborn has deleted their dread presence and scrubbed some posts/comments,” wrote Dread member <em>dontlaugh</em> on Thursday in a new thread in the <em>DarkNetMarkets</em> sub-Dread. “Not looking great for all involved as it would at this stage appear to be an ungraceful exit,” they added.</p>



<p>The post triggered a massive wave of comments from frustrated users, which had nearly exceeded 300 in count within its first 24 hours.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="733" height="467" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dark0de.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1339" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dark0de.jpg 733w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dark0de-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></figure>



<p><em>The famous welcome screen for Dark0de featured original, colorful artwork, giving it some rare personality that set it apart from competitors.</em></p>



<p>While most of Dark0de’s existence was uneventful and smooth for buyers and vendors, some users reported running into deposit and withdrawal issues as early as Dec 2021. On the Dread forum, one Dark0de user reported a XMR deposit requiring over 300 confirmations before funds were credited to their account. Other users commented on the increasing lack of professionalism exhibited by the market’s admins during its last few months.</p>



<p>“They would just make up half-arsed excuses and stall by insisting you prove something they should already be able to do,” said user <em>PaperHat</em> on Dread. “If not crooked, you can&#8217;t trust that level of incompetence either. Sometimes you can just tell someone is a compulsive liar from the way they talk and I got that sense from the admin,” they added.</p>

<p>Dark0de is the fourth major darknet market to go down this year, with the other three being Cartel Market, Monopoly Market and CanadaHQ. All three are believed to have been seized by law enforcement. The market closures to occur this year stand in stark contrast to the comparatively “graceful exits” of White House Market and Cannazon; both of which provided their customers with a warning and ample time to withdraw their funds.</p>



<p>Dark0de was founded in the first half of 2020 and hailed for its comparatively wide range of features, which included support for Monero, Bitcoin multisig transactions, and Direct Pay, which allowed users to send payment to a designated address rather than from a market account balance. These and other features earned it a massive user base in the roughly two years of its existence. There were over 40,000 listings on the market at the time of its closure.</p>

<p>Deaths involving newer designer opioids are <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/583563-opioids-more-powerful-than-fentanyl-found-in-dc-as-overdoses-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the rise</a> across the United States; some of which are readily purchasable on darknet markets. Particularly hard hit is the Washington D.C. area, where the substances are being found in syringes and powders recovered from overdose victims. The chemicals are usually added as adulterants in brand name products &#8212; a practice which often poses significant health risks to the consumer.</p>



<p>Recently-synthesized opiate analogs like sotonitazene, protonitazene and isotonitazene are the new substitutes for fentanyl, which is facing increasing federal scrutiny and abolishment from most darknet markets. The biggest problem, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is that these analogs are <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/isotonitazene.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even more powerful than fentanyl</a> (which is already 50-100 times more potent than morphine).</p>



<p>“We could be on the precipice of something devastating,” <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/new-powerful-opioid-found-on-dc-streets/65-7f37d942-3660-419f-9eab-d9f12ec9ca80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> Alexandra Evans, the chemist responsible for discovering protonitazene in the D.C. drug samples. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already seen mass fatalities because of fentanyl overdoses. Since this is more potent than fentanyl, we do expect an uptick in overdoses.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="884" height="180" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1011" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png 884w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-300x61.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-768x156.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px" /><figcaption><em>ToRReZ Market listing for “Oxycodone” 30 mg pills “made with Isotonitazene.”</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/isotonitazene.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Isotonitazene</a>, one of the three analogs found in the recovered drug samples, is currently for sale in different formulations on at least three major darknet markets, including the ToRReZ, Dark0de and Cartel marketplaces. Though one listing from a China-based supplier was for the chemical in its pure form, most of the time it was mentioned in the listing as being part of a formulation for a different brand, such as Dilaudid and Oxycodone.</p>



<p>A separate wholesale vendor of the product displays the following information about it in their current listing:</p>



<p>“<em>Isotonitazene is a benzimidazole derived opioid analgesic drug related to etonitazene, which has been sold as a designer drug.</em></p>



<p><em>It has only around half the potency of etonitazene in animal studies, but this still makes it a similar strength to fentanyl and its analogues, and consequently isotonitazene can be expected to pose a significant risk of producing life-threatening respiratory depression, as well as other typical opioid side effects such as sedation, itching, nausea and vomiting.” – from vendor MicroDroper</em></p>



<p>Isotonitazene has been blamed for overdose deaths as early as April 2019. Though a few vendors claim the substance is “legal in most of the world” in their listings, it was <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/20/2020-17951/schedules-of-controlled-substances-temporary-placement-of-isotonitazene-in-schedule-i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> to the US DEA Schedule I drugs list in August 2020, rendering it effectively illegal in that country.</p>
