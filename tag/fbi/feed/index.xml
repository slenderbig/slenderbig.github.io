<p><em>No, the FBI did not just “hack Bitcoin.”</em></p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin suffered a FUD-fueled sell-off after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a public <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1402056/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court document</a> today, supporting the seizure of 63.7 BTC from the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attackers. The seizure, performed by a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/08/1004223000/how-a-new-team-of-feds-hacked-the-hackers-and-got-colonial-pipelines-bitcoin-bac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly assembled unit in the FBI</a>, had occurred just hours earlier. News of the unexpected recovery spread quickly on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/07/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-recovered/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainstream news outlets</a> after a brief press conference by the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>A lack of clarity by the DoJ and abundance of speculation on social media led some to believe that <a href="https://decrypt.co/72992/bitcoin-tumbles-9-fears-that-us-law-enforcement-hacked-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the FBI had actually managed to hack the Bitcoin network</a>. This would involve “reverse-engineering” or “brute forcing” their way into finding the private key of the address in question &#8211; a feat long considered impossible &#8211; even with today’s top-of-the-line quantum computers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="905" height="409" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-613" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.png 905w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-300x136.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-768x347.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px" /></figure>



<p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1402056/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>court filing</em></a><em> in the U.S. District Court of Northern California, San Francisco</em></p>



<p>The confusion was compounded by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-used-hackers-bitcoin-password-to-recover-colonial-pipeline-ransom-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incorrect characterizations</a> of what had occurred by several popular websites. The overwhelming wave of negativity triggered a sudden sell-off in the price of BTC, which fell from $35,500 to a low of $32,200 across the day, representing a loss of 9.3%.</p>



<p>Not long after the press conference, a <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanSchachtel/status/1401996717394960389/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warrant</a> was found online related to the seizure which revealed that the FBI had determined the BTC in question was being held in Northern California; most likely by a web wallet service or exchange. The discovery quickly led to the deduction that investigators had not actually managed to “crack” the private key of the address holding the ill-gotten Bitcoin, but rather received it from a California-based company.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m having a tough time believing that this supposedly Russian hacking network was so sophisticated it could shut down our infrastructure, but not knowledgable enough to maintain safe custody over their bitcoin.<br><br>We&#39;re missing the whole story, here&#8230;.</p>&mdash; Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanSchachtel/status/1401988543493332994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to journalist Jordan Schachtel who <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanSchachtel/status/1402010089075183617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered</a> the incident throughout the day, “The entity responsible for the ransomware attack did not in fact have custody over their bitcoin. Instead, they were using a custodian for their funds with servers in the United States.” Schachtel noted the inconsistencies of stories in mainstream media and was quick to dispel incorrect assumptions made by their authors.</p>



<p>“To be clear, there was no hack. Feds did not do something innovative here. They used legal mechanisms and tracked a publicly available ledger to secure the bitcoin from this alleged hacking group.”</p>



<p>Adam Back, the Bitcoin developer employed by Blockstream, provided further confirmation that <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1402179970277982210" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the FBI did not “hack” Bitcoin</a>, and that the panic rocking the market was indeed overblown.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> was NOT hacked<br>No bitcoin wallet was hacked, nor is even known to be possible. Ransom hackers used a rented cloud server. FBI got a subpoena and took control of it and recovered coins. That&#39;s it.</p>&mdash; Adam Back (@adam3us) <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1402179970277982210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Additionally, it appears the effects of the sudden seizure have forced DarkSide, the ransomware group behind the attack, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/darkside-ransomware-gang-quits-after-servers-bitcoin-stash-seized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">into an early retirement</a>. According to KrebsOnSecurity, a message posted by a DarkSide admin on Telegram confirmed the organization had lost access to their infrastructure, and as a result would be ceasing operations. The admin also stated DarkSide would provide decryption tools to infected companies who did not pay a ransom to regain access to their files.</p>
