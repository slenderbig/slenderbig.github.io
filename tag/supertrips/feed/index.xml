										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Convicted Silk Road vendor Maikel Slomp, aka SuperTrips, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/rbzhvc/supertrips_the_pablo_escobar_of_silkroad_did_7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> recently to promote his new memoir, titled “SuperTrips: The Pablo Escobar of Silkroad.” The book, nearly 200 pages in length, was released for sale on Dec 2 and is already proving to be the subject of some controversy in the darknet market community.</p>



<p>According to a description provided on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SuperTrips-Escobar-Silkroad-Dane-Spring/dp/B09MYVPVW1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, the book is “a compendium of the experiences of the successful ‘Pablo Escobar of Silk Road’,” a nickname given to Slomp in an <a href="https://www.vocativ.com/underworld/crime/fallen-kingpins-silk-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">article</a> published in 2014. The nickname was also part of the headline for a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4adjaw/i-made-millions-selling-drugs-online-then-it-all-came-crashing-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Vice</em></a> article which detailed how Slomp had been hospitalized by covid and been released from prison in early April on grounds of compassionate release.</p>



<p>“How else would a simple software programmer who earned meagre sums from gigs, only a month before his exploration in this international business, become a Bitcoin millionaire in a matter of months?” the description posits, before providing an explanation, “The answer is simple, Silk Road!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="900" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1023" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-1.jpg 900w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-1-300x150.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption><em>Photo of Maikel Slomp, aka SuperTrips.

<p></p>



<p>Though Slomp’s numbers as a vendor might be small in comparison to those of modern day darknet pros, his eyewatering estimate of 385,000 BTC received as payment for drug sales was enough for him to earn the title of “Kingpin” by the media. He sold large quantities of MDMA, ecstasy, cocaine, benzodiazepine, amphetamine, LSD, and marijuana from his home country of the Netherlands.</p>



<p>At the height of his career, Slomp decided to retire and sell his Silk Road business to a buyer who had asked to purchase it. The buyer turned out to be an agent from the FBI, who had been on his case since his fingerprints were lifted from a DVD case used to ship product in 2012. Slomp was arrested at the airport in the U.S. and served over seven years in federal prison before his release earlier this year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone claiming to be SuperTrips from Silk Road is on Reddit spruiking a book claiming to be by SuperTrips but he won&#39;t respond to my requests to prove he is SuperTrips. So he may or may not be and I ordered the book anyway</p>&mdash; Eileen Ormsby (@EileenOrmsby) <a href="https://twitter.com/EileenOrmsby/status/1469157888425807876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Slomp, who seems to enjoy playing off the infamy of his SuperTrips persona, has made personal appeals on both Reddit and Dread, attempting to drum up business for his book. “I’m notorious, and if I can make some money off of that, it’s fine with me,” he told <em>Vice</em> back in April.</p>



<p>Communities from both social media platforms were slow to respond, and the response that trickled in tended to be less than positive.</p>



<p>“Helping feds to build a case vs Ross. That’s a no for me,” said one Redditor, who seemed to speak for the majority of those who were interested. As with similar criticism on Dread, Slomp was quick to respond, absolving himself of responsibility. Although he offered to testify against Ross Ulbricht &#8211; founder of Silk Road &#8211; in exchange for a lesser sentence, Slomp was never called to the witness stand in his trial.</p>
