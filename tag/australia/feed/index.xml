<p>An Australian trio is being accused of using darknet markets to sell approximately $25,000 a day in drugs to customers throughout their country. Erin Gold (32), Thomas Booker (27) and Ryan Suri-Tucker (24) are believed by prosecutors to be the team behind the <em>Underline Cost</em> vendor moniker. Under that name, authorities allege the trio arranged for the sale of millions of dollars of several different drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, marijuana, and LSD.</p>



<p>The trio came under suspicion after a package from Luxembourg containing 8,000 LSD tabs destined for an associated address was seized by customs in southern Australia. A phone number on the package was later found to be registered to a mailbox through which Booker regularly sent packages of drugs destined for the dark web. Police also made purchases from listings offered by <em>Underline Cost</em> and matched fingerprints found on the packages to two of the individuals.</p>

<p>Both Gold and Booker seemed to be rather public figures in Adelaide, posing for multiple pictures with each other across the years; some of which <a href="https://amp.adelaidenow.com.au/coronavirus/pubs-open-but-dday-looms-for-hoteliers/news-story/e52a49f2e2279b5cef1e3c5bf8373a3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">appeared</a> in the same publication that broke the story of their arrest, over a year later. Gold had a particularly public career as part of a burlesque dancer group based out of the area, <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/sa/adelaide-cabaret-fringe-program-launch-ng-26220f8cb3b50280659f5e22a716fb0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">performing regularly</a> at the Adelaide Cabaret Fringe.</p>

<p>The two male suspects &#8211; Booker and Suri-Tucker &#8211; were first arrested in November while “sitting at a desk piled with drugs,” in the middle of processing orders for their vendor operation, which was based out of a property in the King’s Park region of Adelaide. Gold was arrested while at work during her primary job as an accountant. Booker is said to have worked as a police officer until 2016.</p>



<p>In addition to large stashes of different drugs, police also confiscated $350,000 in cash from the three, later locating an additional $460,000 in a trustee lockbox.</p>
