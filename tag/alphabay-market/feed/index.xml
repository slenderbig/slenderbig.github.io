<p>It appears that AlphaBay, once one of the worlds biggest darknet markets, is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/alphabay-darknet-market-back-tom-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now back in operation</a>, following an announcement by one of the market’s former admins.</p>



<p>On Sunday, a message posted to the popular darknet forum <em>Dread</em> contained a PGP-signed <a href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/ce2fdff4c9b511d944c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> from DeSnake, a previous AlphaBay admin, which outlined plans for the continued operation of the once-deceased market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="398" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay-1024x398.png" alt="" class="wp-image-751" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay-1024x398.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay-768x298.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay.png 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The message, also <a href="https://ghostbin.com/paste/SZqmV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pasted in full</a> on the clearnet by DeSnake, is lengthy and provides the framework for a new model of darknet market that attempts to incorporate some ambitious elements to help protect the safety of its users and their funds.</p>



<p>“I know all of you lost millions to seizure from Law Enforcement,” writes DeSnake. “This time around I have created a very well tested system called AlphaGuard which ensures even if seizures happen on all servers, users will be able to withdraw their funds, settle disputes and leave without a cent lost.”</p>



<p>The message also covers guidelines for the market’s new administration, community functions, the setup of its forum, rules, and a thorough explanation of why DeSnake decided to return.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AlphaBay &#8211; one of the largest darknet markets ever to operate &#8211; was shut down by US law enforcement in 2017. But now it&#39;s back: <a href="https://t.co/3gpfv6C0df">https://t.co/3gpfv6C0df</a></p>&mdash; Tom Robinson (@tomrobin) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomrobin/status/1424782284159324163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Although the message could not be independently verified using standard PGP tools, the admin of the Dread forum, Paris, had the following to say about the recent re-emergence of DeSnake:</p>



<p>“To reduce any-kind of FUD that comes from this announcement. This user did verify his identity and provide proof that he was the tech staff at the original AlphaBay. <strong>It&#8217;s legitimate</strong>. I&#8217;m not saying he isn&#8217;t compromised; but if what he offers is true, at least some people will want to know about it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="485" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay2-1024x485.png" alt="" class="wp-image-752" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay2-1024x485.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay2-300x142.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay2-768x364.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alphabay2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another former admin of AlphaBay, disc0, chimed in shortly thereafter, confirming that he had also been in contact with DeSnake, who mentioned “things that only he knew as a staff member of AlphaBay.” Both Paris and disc0 said they cryptographically confirmed DeSnake’s presence using the PGP keys he provided.</p>



<p>Accordingly, AlphaBay was given a market page of its own on <em>Dread</em>, and DeSnake has been promoted to an admin position. The side of the page gives the following description of what AlphaBay is to be in its second life:</p>



<p>“Legendary AlphaBay Market (est. 2014) has re-opened.</p>



<p>Almost same administration as in 2014-2017 period which means you will find again AlphaBay runs with mature management, unparalleled security, 24/7 professional &amp; well-trained Staff and of course unique vision for the future not only for itself but for the darknet market scene too.”</p>



<p>At its height, AlphaBay handled approximately 10-fold the sales of original darknet market, Silk Road. The market was taken offline in July 2017, as part of a multinational law enforcement effort. The market’s founder, Alexander Cazes, committed suicide in a Thai jail cell while waiting extradition to the United States on charges of drug laundering.</p>



<p>The “new” AlphaBay is also hosted on I2P, a hidden services network similar to Tor.</p>



<p>Some of the main differences between the new market and old are:</p>



<ul><li>The new market is Monero-only.</li><li>No fentanyl or related products.</li><li>No activity related to the countries of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan.</li><li>No ransomware-related activity.</li></ul>



<p>The revamped AlphaBay market was still offline as of the publishing of this article.</p>
