					<description><![CDATA[I see these bad reviews here but I had an excellent buying experience with Versus so just wanted to shoutout.  I know it’s like Russian roulette sometimes with dark markets but here my anecdote. I bought on the afternoon of 3/22/22 and by the next morning it had been accepted and said shipped before I went to bed. Received the order Saturday 3/26 with no problems. Now, I did place an order with that very same vendor on Monday night 3/21 and it held pending for a day or so and then I clicked on the seller&#039;s info page and saw that I had formatted the address wrong as per his particular request on formatting. It held as pending for a few days, then changed to Expired by like Thurs or Friday.  I assumed it was because of my address formatting error. Anyway since I used 2-2 multisig, I have to wait for them to refund me. It’s out of my hands. But I could’ve used 2-3 multisig and supposedly I’d be able to request my refund and get it right away.  Anyway that was a near perfect experience by a first time buyer on 3/22/22.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have 2 orders paid and confirmed on the blockchain yet the status still said unpaid for 2 days when it reverted to expired. 

No one has answered me despite opening a ticket 2 days ago.

Very suspect!]]></description>
