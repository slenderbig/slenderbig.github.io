<p>The United States is ramping up its efforts to combat an opioid addiction crisis by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-hampshire-john-cornyn-maggie-hassan-congress-db31d8f3d0ed0a28bafd37e82e62612c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">introducing a legislative bill</a> specifically targeting drug dealers on <a href="/darknet-markets-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darknet markets</a>. The bill, titled the Dark Web Interdiction Act, would increase penalties for dealers convicted of selling any type of illegal drug over the dark web. It was crafted by Senators Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and John Cornyn of Texas and introduced to the senate on Wednesday, Mar 9.</p>



<p>If passed into law, the Dark Web Interdiction Act would also direct the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and Treasury to provide a report to Congress “detailing the use of cryptocurrency on the dark web.” In addition, it would give recommendations to Congress on how to best approach the use of cryptocurrency as it pertains to opioid sales on the darknet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The dark web has become a hotspot for illegal sales of fentanyl and other deadly drugs that are fueling the opioid crisis.<br><br>This week Senator Cornyn and I introduced a bill to crack down on these illegal marketplaces and increase penalties for dealers. <a href="https://t.co/ahZvesSMMJ">https://t.co/ahZvesSMMJ</a></p>&mdash; Sen. Maggie Hassan (@SenatorHassan) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorHassan/status/1501932037401284614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>“Drug dealers are using the dark corners of the internet to sell deadly drugs that are fueling the substance misuse crisis in New Hampshire and across the country,” wrote Hassan in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHassan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a> post announcing the introduction of the bill.</p>



<p>“<em>I am teaming up with Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas to crack down on those caught trafficking drugs on the dark web, target international fentanyl trafficking from China and Mexico, and strengthen our overall efforts to disrupt and dismantle these illegal marketplaces.” – Senator Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire</em></p>



<p>Hassan, Cornyn, and Senator Dianne Feinstein first <a href="https://www.hassan.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20re%20Dark%20Web%20Opioid%20Trafficking-FINAL.9.14.20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">requested information</a> pertaining to the government’s current efforts to crack down on darknet market drug sales in September 2020. In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, the subcommittee specifically mentioned dark web sales of fentanyl as their primary concern, along with other highly-powerful opioids.</p>



<p>“Tens of thousands of Americans die every year from opioid overdoses,” the subcommittee mentioned in the letter – a problem which worsened considerably in the US over the next two years that followed. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest estimates</a> provided by the Center for Disease Control reveal that over 75,000 Americans now die of opiate overdoses on an annual scale, accounting for about 76% of all drug overdose fatalities in the nation.</p>



<p>While many darknet markets operating today implement a strict no-fentanyl or related analog policy, threatening to ban vendors caught selling these times, fentanyl is still frequently <a href="https://archives.drugabuse.gov/emerging-trends/fake-prescription-drugs-laced-fentanyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used as</a><a href="https://archives.drugabuse.gov/emerging-trends/fake-prescription-drugs-laced-fentanyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> a</a><a href="https://archives.drugabuse.gov/emerging-trends/fake-prescription-drugs-laced-fentanyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n adulterant</a> in many fake pill formulations. These include products branded as Oxycontin, Percocet, Hydrocodone, and even Xanax.</p>

<p>A 55-year-old Florida man was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/florida-man-sentenced-selling-counterfeit-drugs-dark-net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced</a> to 36 months in prison earlier this week for selling hundreds of thousands of “fake Xanax” pills on the darknet, wrapping up a 10-month court case initiated by the FBI Washington Field Office. According to prosecutors, Benjamin Burdick, of Inverness, Florida, conducted his sales under the vendor name <em>Rangoon</em> on Empire Market between Apr 2019 and Oct 2020.</p>



<p>Investigator tests of the pills found they contained a mixture of benzodiazepines, including etizolam, adinazolam, and flualprazolam; the latter being a variant of the active ingredient in Xanax (alprazolam). The pills were pressed using microcrystalline cellulose as a filler – a substance which Burdick had received shipments of at a return address he used when mailing orders for his Empire Market customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="763" height="428" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-795" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-1.jpg 763w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /></figure>



<p><em>Scene from the removal of the pill pressing operation at the Burdick residence. Source: Citrus County Sheriff’s Office.</em></p>



<p>The result of a year-long investigation that yielded a search warrant, Burdick’s home was <a href="https://tampa.cbslocal.com/2020/10/17/dark-web-bust-2-arrested-and-16000-pills-143k-firearms-seized-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raided</a> on Oct 14, 2020, where he was arrested by law enforcement. Discovered at the residence was around 16,000 pressed “fake Xanax” pills, $143,000 in cash and several firearms. The pills, which weighed around 15 lbs. in all, had already been pre-packaged in different sizes according to listings posted by <em>Rangoon</em> on Empire Market.</p>



<p>Among the other evidence collected during the raid was a stamp which Burdick used to press the word “XANAX” on each pill. In all, Burdick is thought to have sold nearly 250,000 pills, which frequently changed in chemical content. Burdick’s wife, who allegedly helped him prepare the pills for sale, was also arrested during the raid, and faces similar charges.</p>



<p>After purchasing several orders of the pills from <em>Rangoon</em> on Empire Market, law enforcement used surveillance at a local post office to identify Burdick as the recipient of a package of microcrystalline cellulose. This was later traced to the content of the pressed pills.</p>



<p>A GPS tracker placed on Burdick’s car revealed he drove to a post office in a nearby city to deliver 56 packages. One of these packages was addressed to a Virginia resident who later gave law enforcement permission to open the package and analyze its contents. Additional purchases and surveillance conducted between Aug and Sept 2020 then gave investigators the evidence required for the search warrant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last month’s arrest of Monero developer and former maintainer Riccardo Spagni, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FluffyPony</em></a>, has left many in the XMR community <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=753252.msg57608492#msg57608492" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on edge</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NightArbitrage/status/1429934107648315396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculating</a> if there are hidden motives behind it.</p>



<p>Spagni was arrested in the U.S. on July 21 at the behest of the South African government after trying to board a chartered flight to the nation, his home country. News of the arrest, however, did not break until Aug 2, when court documents were <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tnmd.87126/gov.uscourts.tnmd.87126.3.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> by a Tennessee district court. The news was confirmed when Spagni’s wife Saskia <a href="https://twitter.com/Spatzipantz/status/1422304460278276096">tweeted</a> a response on his behalf.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/2 Thank you everyone for your kind messages and in this matter.  <br>A message from <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@fluffypony</a>: Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding with regards to the setting of court dates in an old matter, which I have continuously been trying to resolve since 2011,</p>&mdash; Saskia Spagni (@Spatzipantz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Spatzipantz/status/1422304460278276096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>On the same date, Spagni was <a href="https://twitter.com/binaryFate/status/1422336732435947521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped</a> of his access to Monero-related repositories out of fears he “could be pressured while in custody.” This also took away his ability to access a developer fund equal to some 5,577 XMR.</p>



<p>More recently, Spagni was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/monero-developer-riccardo-spagni-denied-bail-after-court-brands-him-a-flight-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied bail</a> late last week after a judge deemed his massive cryptocurrency holdings rendered him a flight risk.</p>



<p>“I’m worried about him being a Monero core team member who could be held indefinitely,” <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=753252.msg57616328#msg57616328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a Bitcointalk forum member in a popular thread dedicated to the coin.</p>



<p>“<em>I know it’s mostly fun and games from our end in the forum trading these coins but XMR is a serious project. Try listening to the stuff </em><a href="https://twitter.com/binaryFate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>binaryFate</em></a><em> (sp) talks about. It’s like he’s into some serious deep sh*t.”</em> &#8211; tokeweed, Bitcointalk forum member.</p>



<p>The advanced privacy features of XMR, which render the details of its transfer nearly untraceable, make it a favorite among darknet market users and cybercriminals. This has led some to believe that Spagni’s unique relationship with Monero could potentially prove to be valuable in the U.S. federal government’s efforts to curb crime related to its usage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doh. I guess <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@fluffypony</a> is stuck in jail still. Dang, that order is some harsh.<a href="https://t.co/0bmEfRormH">https://t.co/0bmEfRormH</a></p>&mdash; midnight (@midmagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/midmagic/status/1428439931190341635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Spatzipantz/status/1422533018397384709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter</a> re-tweeted by the dev on the date of his arrest, Spagni’s attorneys describe his arrest as “irregular and unwarranted,” going on to describe how their client was the victim of an administrative error which led to the erroneous issuing of an arrest warrant.</p>



<p>“In the circumstances… our client was arrested for his alleged failure to appear in court, and nothing more,” the letter states. “This issue is currently being addressed with the authorities and what is sought is agreement between all parties as to further court dates for the hearing of the matter.”</p>



<p>Further adding to the confusion are the lawyer’s notes that the case is nowhere near “trial ready,” which makes the expeditious apprehension of Spagni even more of a mystery.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow. <a href="https://twitter.com/fluffypony?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@fluffypony</a> has apparently been arrested. He is in U.S. custody.<br><br>It was only a month ago that he reached out to me via DM and offered support and kind words. Now he’s facing his own legal troubles.<br><br>Wish him all the best. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f61e.png" alt="😞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; Cøbra (@CobraBitcoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/1422267870109749248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At the crux of the matter are allegations that Spagni generated approx. $100,000 in fake invoices while employed by Cape Cookies, a South African food production company, in 2011. According to court documents, South African prosecutors allege Spagni intercepted invoices from a company that delivered goods and services to his employer, using them to craft fictitious invoices, and replacing the pay-to information with his own.</p>



<p>The South African government has 60 days to submit documents required for an extradition hearing – a period which is set to expire on Sept 19.</p>
